Welcome to my first project with Get Coding!

This is a Mental Health & Wellbeing Tracker for your everyday human who needs a bit of help understanding why their health is the way it is.

This tracker is being designed out of necessity.  I have chronically ill friends and family who have always had a hard time keeping track of their health to report back to their doctors.  This program should help in various ways:

- The journal section will have the option to flag entries, which will then be compiled in a separate page as items to address with a doctor; and,

- The trackers will compile date to show weekly and monthly summaries, which should help direct the user to reasons why their health may have increased or declined during certain periods of time.
